#Event Manager
Created following Jumpstart Lab's [EventManager](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/eventmanager.html) tutorial.
Fictitious event manager obtains legislator information based on users zip code. Then creates an email communication form listing legislators and phone numbers.

After completing this tutorial, you will be able to:

* manipulate file input and output
* read content from a CSV (Comma Separated Value) file
* transform it into a standardized format
* utilize the data to contact a remote service
* populate a template with user data
* manipulate strings
* access Sunlightâ€™s Congressional API through the Sunlight Congress gem
* use ERB (Embedded Ruby) for templating

This project is part of [The Odin Project's](http://www.theodinproject.com) Ruby Curriculum. More information [here](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/file-i-o-and-serialization)
